Team Name: AUT Orientation
Description: This game is a recreation of the south campus AUT so that players are
able to experience the AUT life virtually. Game features have been added to make the
experience more entertaining and organic.

Tools: Our game is built using Unity and will need Unity installed to run the game.
	To read the scripts we suggest visual studios while notepad will work.
